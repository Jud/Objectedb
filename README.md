#Objectedb &mdash; The Mysql Object Framework

*Warning: This framework is alpha at best. I quickly created it as a proof of concept to see if this kind of database design was even practical. As such, some features are incomplete or missing; Documentation is scarce, and the code is like Walmart Brand spaghetti.*

With that out of the way, I would also like to ask for help from the community. If you see a better way of doing something - fork the repo and submit the changes back into the main line.
